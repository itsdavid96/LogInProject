PHP Log in and Register. 

At the moment this project only runs locally. 

You want to install a XAMPP server. Here is a brief tutorial on how to do that https://itsdavid96.github.io/2021/04/17/blog-7.html
Make sure your XAMPP server's apache and mysql are runnning.
Access your localhost/phpmyadmin and create a database named secure_login_system. Note: You can change the name but will have to go into source code and change database connection. 
Add the databse SQL tables from the repository to your database. 
Finally access your localhost to access the login and register pages.
